- Write man pages!

Things that are not yet implemented in tabackup:

- Be able to specify archival of volume, it's not implemented yet.

- Be able to specify subdirectories inside volume to backup.

- Support to give EXCLUDE etc. directives in dsm.sys.

- Use localauth.  Do not work at all.

- Use TSM logging functions.

- Escape control characters (below ascii 32) in filenames.

Things that are not yet implemented in tarestore:

- Understand afs so that a volume can be written back directly into 
  another volume.

- Restore ACLs.

- Better restore command-line syntax, currently requires knowledge of 
  TSM internals.
