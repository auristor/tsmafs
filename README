Howto get started:

I have only compiled this on Linux RHEL4 with the TSM 5.4 API.

1) Fetch the source. 
2) Modify the Makefile if the tsm headers are not in a standard place.
3) Be sure that the afs headers and libraries are installed in the system.
4) Compile.

...now you should have tabackup and tarestore.

5) Create (via tsm tools) an environment that uses password=generate, so
   that the backup programs don't have to care about tsm auth.  Use the
   same nodename in TSM even if you have multiple AFS file servers, so that
   a moved volume will be backed up only once.
6) Fetch a token for an user that have enough power to read the volumes.
7) Try "tabackup -v mytestvolume" to see if it works. Running it multiple
   times should only save files the first time.

Note that tabackup only reads backup volumes, but it do not create them.
You have to do that yourself before running tabackup.
